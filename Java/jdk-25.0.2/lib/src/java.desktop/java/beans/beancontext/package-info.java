/**
 * Provides classes and interfaces relating to bean context. A bean context is a
 * container for beans and defines the execution environment for the beans it
 * contains. There can be several beans in a single bean context, and a bean
 * context can be nested within another bean context. This package also
 * contains events and listener interface for beans being added and removed from
 * a bean context.
 * <p>
 * These APIs are now both obsolete and express an <em>anti-pattern</em> of component
 * assembly and interaction.
 * <p>
 * This package has been deprecated and may be removed in a future version of
 * the Java Platform. There is no replacement.
 * <p>
 * All of the classes and interfaces in this package have been terminally deprecated.
 * <p>
 * Users are advised to migrate their applications to other technologies.
