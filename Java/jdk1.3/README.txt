Introduction

     Thank you for downloading this release of the Java(TM) 2 SDK,
     Standard Edition. The Java 2 SDK is a development environment for
     building applications, applets, and components that can be
     deployed on the Java platform.

     The Java 2 SDK software includes tools useful for developing and
     testing programs written in the Java programming language and
     running on the Java platform. These tools are designed to be used
     from the command line. Except for appletviewer, these tools do not
     provide a graphical user interface.

     The Java 2 SDK comes with the Java Plug-in product. You can use 
     the Java Plug-in product to enable the Internet Explorer and 
     Netscape Navigator browsers to run applets based on the Java 2 
     Platform. For more information about the Java Plug-in product, 
     see the section titled "Java 2 Runtime Environment and Java 
     Plug-in" in the README.html file.


Installation

     The complete Java 2 SDK is composed of the SDK Software plus the 
     SDK Documentation, each of which is separately downloadable.
     Installation instructions are maintained on the
     Java Developer Connection web site:

     http://java.sun.com/jdc/earlyAccess/j2sdk13/install-windows-sdk.html

     Refer to the copyright and license for legal terms of use.


Features

     The version 1.3 of the Java 2 SDK offers significant improvements in 
     functionality and performance over previous versions. See:

        * Summary of New Features - Features added since version 1.2 
          of the Java 2 SDK.
          http://java.sun.com/j2se/sdk/1.3/docs/relnotes/features.html

Demos

     A demo directory is included in this software bundle with a
     variety of applets, Swing applications, and other examples for 
     you to try out. The demos come with complete source code.


Java 2 SDK Documentation

     The on-line Java 2 SDK Documentation contains API specifications,
     developer guides, tool reference pages, demos, and links to
     related information. It is located at

     http://java.sun.com/j2se/sdk/1.3/docs/

     The Java 2 SDK documentation is also available in a download bundle 
     which you can install locally with your Java 2 SDK software. See the 
     Java 2 SDK download page: 
     
     http://java.sun.com/jdc/earlyAccess/j2sdk13/


System Requirements

     Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows NT 4.0, or Windows 2000 operating 
     systems running on Intel hardware. A Pentium 166 MHz or faster 
     processor.

     At least 32 megabytes of physical RAM is required to run GUI 
     applications. Forty-eight megabytes is recommended for applets 
     running within a browser using the Java Plug-in product. 
     Running with less memory may cause disk swapping which has a severe 
     effect on performance. Very large programs may require more RAM for 
     adequate performance. 

     You should have 65 megabytes of free disk space before attempting 
     to install the Java 2 SDK software. If you also install the 
     separate documentation download bundle, you need an additional 120 
     megabytes of free disk space.
